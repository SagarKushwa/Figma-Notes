# Figma-Notes

## What is figma?
- Figma is a powerful design tool that helps you to create anything: websites, applications, logos, and much more.

## Figma's two products:-
### 1. Figma design:-
   - It is for people to create, share, and test designs for websites, mobile apps, and other digital products and experiences. It is a popular tool for designers, product managers, writers and developers and helps anyone involved in the design process contribute, give feedback, and make better decisions, faster.
### 1. FigJam:-
   - It lets you create online whiteboards where anyone can take part. People often use FigJam for meetings, brainstorms, diagrams, planning, and research. In FigJam, you can use text, shapes, drawings, images, sticky notes, and other elements to visually represent ideas and jam on work together.

## What is the difference between Figma design and FigJam?
- Figma design and FigJam are two products that, when used together, support your entire design process. While you might begin brainstorming and sketching your ideas in FigJam, when you're ready to start designing and then prototyping, you'd likely move over to Figma design.
